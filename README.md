# Stormy

In this sample App Project I created, for the first time, an App that conncets to the Internet to download weather data
from the free API forecast.io.

These are the topics used in this App:
* Permissions
* Networking
* OkHttp
* Use an API (forecast.io)
* Parsing JSON
* Using a DialogFragment
